# AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP
*COMPANY NAME* : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME* : KATTHULWAR VIGNITHA

*INTERN ID* : CT04WM48

*DOMAIN* : PYTHON PROGRAMMING

*DURATION* : 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR* : NEELA SANTHOSH

I focused on developing and integrating chatbots using Python. For building the chatbot logic, I used libraries like ChatterBot and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for natural language processing tasks.
To preprocess and analyze text data, Pandas and re (regular expressions) were used. The coding and testing were mainly done in google colab and Visual Studio Code.The key fields I worked on during this internship included Natural Language Processing (NLP), API integration, Machine Learning basics, and Conversational AI development, where Python provided powerful tools to create dynamic and responsive chatbot systems.
I worked on Automated Report Generation using Python, where the focus was on extracting data, analyzing it, and generating professional reports without manual effort. I used Pandas for data handling and processing, Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visual graphs and charts.The major fields involved in this project included data extraction and transformation (ETL), data visualization, template rendering, and document automation, helping in reducing manual work and improving efficiency in reporting tasks.
I have involved in Machine Learning Model Implementation using Python, where the objective was to develop, train, and evaluate predictive models on real-world datasets. I used libraries like scikit-learn for building classification, regression, and clustering models, and Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and feature engineering. For model evaluation and visualization, I utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot confusion matrices, learning curves, and feature importance graphs. In some advanced tasks.The key fields I worked on included data preprocessing, model building, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning, helping bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical machine learning applications.
This internship gave me a valuable opportunity to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications. It enhanced my technical expertise in API integration and data visualization, and prepared me for future professional challenges in the field of data analytics and software development.
